# Metro-Exodus-Gold-Edition-Max-Settings-Config
A config file I created using the gold edition of Metro Exodus that fixes alot of performance issues without decreasing any graphical options


- Improved FPS
- Ultra settings with all settings maxed or enabled are capable on very low hardware @ 1080p (excluding hairworks)
- When looking at certain scenes - the train in volga - The FPS drops have been decreased and should be alot more bearable
- Made to be used in conjunction with The Ultra Realism Cine FX reshade preset created by Kycok_Xleba (http://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/11012/) after enabling the preset, I also enable Fidelity FX, you dont need to do this but it costs very little in resources.

Notes and other improvements that can be made:
- Disable fullscreen optimisations under compatibility mode
- Do Not run in ANY compatibility mode, it kills FPS... I used it as a fix for the dx12 bug where I couldnt get past the first screen. after this, it isnt needed, so turn it back off after the game starts up correctly
- I dont use any vsync, freesync or otherwise, not even a frame limiter, but on higher end hardware feel free to limit fps, just know it isnt on by default

AMD Driver options under the game profile:
- Tesselation = AMD Optimized
- Freesync = Off
- Texture Quality = High
- everything else is disabled or left up to the game


Testing Hardware:
AMD A10 6930P 2.6 ghz quad core APU w/ R5 iGpu and RX460 4GB GDDR5 dGPU, 500GB SATA drive and 2x8gb 2400mhz dual channel ram running o Windows 10 21H1

Minimum Requirements:
Anything better than the above... I'll put my neck out and say that a Ryzen 5 3400G w/ Vega 11 iGPU could play Metro Exodus comfortably at 1080p using this config. Mainly because a vega 11 has twice the Time Spy score than the hardware mentioned above.


Enjoy
